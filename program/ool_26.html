title: "Time for a Background Check! Uncovering the Influence of Background Features on Deep Neural Networks"
abstract: "With increasing expressive power, deep neural networks have significantly improved the state-of-the-art on image classification datasets, such as ImageNet. However, with this progress, the improvement in the quality of learned representations is still unclear. In particular, we ask whether the modern deep neural networks start exploiting correlations with background features to achieve higher accuracy on the test images. We answer this question in two distinct frameworks: 1) performance solely with background features 2) performance when abstain or switching image background. Our experimental results for thirty different networks shows that current DNNs do have a tendency, and it increases with expressive power, to exploit background features to solve the task at hand."
